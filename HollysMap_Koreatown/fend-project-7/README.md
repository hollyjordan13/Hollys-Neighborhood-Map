## Specifications

In the Neighborhood Map project, I created a single page app that allows you to search, and see map information about a selection of popular restaurants in the area, specifically Korean BBQ. The map by default shows markers of all selected locations while the search feature allows you to filture your selections and see a photo of the venue. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application. This project will demonstrate the skills I have learned for using React and APIs, as well as JavaScript.


## Instructions

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* to run the app in production build (with react app service worker): 
	npm run build
	serve -s build
	And then visit localhost:5000
* obtain Google Maps and Foursquare API key

##Considerations

* React favors categorizing functionalities into components
* How to display venues/information about markers in sidebar 
* Animation with the markers when first opening app and when certain venues are filtered
* Correct implementation of APIs
* Search functionality
* InfoWindow functionality and implementation of Foursquare's venue information and photos
